# Student Comment
Hi, Yulia. It's great to have you back and thanks again for taking your time to review my project and leaving great comments.

You were on point about the notebook file lacking content as I read the focus of this project was on the web app and not the notebook. 
Also, because the web app portion took so much energy out of me that I didn't focus on the notebook as much thinking that it's only supplemental.

But thank you very much for pointing this out and give me tips and instructions on how to populate the notebook. 
I should know better that good visualizations mean nothing when the underlying data has missing values and is not properly pre-processed. Garbage in, garbage out.

I've doned the data pre-processing as instruted, please review it again and let me know if anything needs further modification.

Best regards :D
